# Pokemon Database Website
- Project by Morgan D. from Mult 213
- January 23, 2023
- Website made to grab data from Pokemon JSON file and display the data
- Designed to practice javascript and JSON 

# About This Project
This project was created to take JSON data and turn it into a website. This was used as practice for my class on advanced javascript MULT-213. Probably not the most functionally correct or optimized code, but it works. ðŸ˜Ž

It uses the following languages:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (Vanilla)
- JSON

Many people want to find important stats about their pokemon quickly. Often these stats are hidden form the player in game or are hard to find through game interface. This Pokemon wesbite is designed to display important stats about your pokemon without having to guess.

This project was also used as practice / an assignment to help practice Javascript and grabbing data from JSON files.

# How It Works

The script file grabs the JSON data and loops through the data to attach itself to the HTML. The script has step-by-step instructions. However, this project is old and I would need to update it to make it work more in seperate functions rather than one big one.
